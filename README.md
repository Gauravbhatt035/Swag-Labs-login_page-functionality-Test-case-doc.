# Login Functionality Test Report Summary
I performed manual testing on the login functionality of a web application with the objective of validating both usability and behavior across various scenarios. This involved:

 a. Testing valid and invalid login flows

 b. Verifying error messages for empty or incorrect input fields

 c. Checking presence of essential UI elements like “Forgotten Password?” and “Create New Account”

 d. Ensuring cross-browser and responsive design compatibility

 e. Confirming brand consistency and visual completeness

# Test Coverage:
